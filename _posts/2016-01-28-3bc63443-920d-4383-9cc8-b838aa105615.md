**The idea of Canada (East) Films Inc. was first conceived in the 90's. It began with formal training in the field of film, digital imaging and video production by its president and founder, Michael Stephen McKinnon. After years of training and development through courses and practical experience, the company was officially formed in 2007\.   We intend to expand our professional relations further, and recruit a strong and committed staff.**
